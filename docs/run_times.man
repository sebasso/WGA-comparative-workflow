Comparison:
	- Campylobacter assemblies
		2 hours and 33 minutes

	- Campylobacter reads(ksnp only):
		running

	- Ecoli assemblies
		4 hours and 14 minutes

	- Ecoli reads(ksnp only):
		needs parser for reads as they are in .gz files


Simulation:
	- Campylobacter reference with 40 genomes
		20 minutes ??? 

	- Ecoli reference with 40 genome
		5 hours and 10 minutes
